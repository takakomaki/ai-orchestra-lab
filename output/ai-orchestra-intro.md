# AI Orchestra

AI Orchestra is a small practice space where Taka and multiple AIs learn to co-create.
Obsidian keeps the ideas and intentions, GitHub manages structure, and Cursor helps shape everything into real outputs.
This file is the very first note of our AI Orchestra.

This is the first introductory note of the AI Orchestra project.

This orchestra begins with a single note of intention.
